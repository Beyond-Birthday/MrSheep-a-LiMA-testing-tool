# MrSheep : a LiMA testing tool

**Mr Sheep is a testing tool available on both Linux and Windows**


**What does it do ?**

It *tests* the LiMA website (https://lima.soc.port.ac.uk/) by taking sources screenshots
and comparing them with test ones.

For example, if your website works perfectly as you want it to, you can take sources screenshots and compare to the ones you'll take after each update to see what has changed, if it is normal or not.

You can also create tests yourself by following the documentation available in each folder and following the examples in the code.

**What are the requirements for these programs ?**

You'll need to learn the basics in Python 3 / Python 3.5 / xpath

You'll also need to follow the documentation on each folder.

**What if I have problems/issues ?**

Just create an issue in Github or post a Pull Request.

**Why Mr Sheep ?**

Why not. Sheeps are funny, they are always staring things, like the program.
