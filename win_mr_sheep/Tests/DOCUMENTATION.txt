Introduction

This version is for Windows with Google Chrome installed and Python 3.5,
It requires PIL, Selenium, unittest, shutils in order to work.

CleverSheep is a testing tool for the LiMA website still in Work In Progress.
It creates screeshots of the website when it's working how you want it.
Then it compares these to new ones after an update, a change, an edit etc...
It compute the differencies between two screenshots and list all the differencies.

I. How to install

First, clone the Github repository
Then you'll have something like this :

UI testing
|-Analysis/
| |-percent.txt
| |-source_percent.txt
|-Driver/
| |-chromedriver.exe
|-Sources/ 
|-Tests/
|-create_sources.py
|-credidentials.txt
|-run_tests.py

In order to run things properly, you need Python 3.5 and PIL, Selenium, unittest, shutils.

If none of this is installed :
	Install anaconda for Windows w/ Python 3.5
	Open anaconda prompt
	Install missing libraries


II. How to create sources

In order to create sources, you need run create_sources.py in Spyder or in the Windows' cmd
Here are the options :
-i to get all the infos
-s to run silent mode
-b to reduce test output

for example, just run '''python create_sources.py -b -i'''
(without the ''')

The program will run tests twice to get a scale for the differencies.
The differencies will be stored in Analysis/source_percent.txt
The screenshots will be saved in Sources/s_[DATE] and in Sources/f_[DATE]

III. How to make tests

In order to create sources, you need run create_sources.py in Spyder or in the Windows' cmd
Here are the options :
-s to run silent mode
-b to reduce test output

for example, just run '''python run_tests.py -b'''
(without the ''')

The program will take screenshots and compare them to the source ones.
The differencies will be stored in Analysis/percents.txt
The screenshots will be saved in Tests/t_[DATE]
